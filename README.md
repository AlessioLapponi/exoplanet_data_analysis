This project performs a small but rigorous data analysis on exoplanets using real data from the **NASA Exoplanet Archive** (Planetary Systems — PS Table).  
The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**, **data cleaning**, **data visualization**, and **basic exploratory analysis** using Python.
